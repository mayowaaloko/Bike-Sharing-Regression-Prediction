# Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction Dataset

## Overview

Bike sharing systems provide a convenient means of renting bicycles, allowing users to pick up and return bikes from various kiosk locations across a city. These systems generate valuable data, including travel duration, departure and arrival locations, and elapsed time. Researchers use this data to study mobility patterns in urban areas.

In this dataset, we focus on the **Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.** Participants in the Kaggle competition are tasked with predicting bike rental demand by combining historical usage patterns with weather data.

## Key Points

- **Objective**: Forecast bike rental demand based on historical usage and weather information.
- **Data Features**:
  - **Weather Data**: Includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant factors.
  - **Usage Patterns**: Historical bike rental counts.
- **Business Impact**: Insights can help optimize bike distribution, pricing strategies, and revenue for bike-sharing providers.

## Acknowledgements

- The dataset was provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork using data from Capital Bikeshare.
- We also thank the UCI machine learning repository for hosting the dataset.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)**. The formula for RMSLE is provided in the competition details.
